This is a project called "Taste Haven"! The idea of this project is a website and an app where users can upload their own recipes and recipe collections (an article style page with multiple recipes that have a common theme, uses same ingredients, etc.), and other users can view them. You'll be able to save other's recipes to (only) your private collections.

This is going to be an open-source project, so feel free to contribute your efforts into making this project amazing! (I'm new to coding and stuff like that, so any help at all to even optimise code is greatly appreciated!)
All I require you to do before contributing to this project is to read the license. If you do not co and side with the license then do not contribute.

Thank you!
